# The Ping-Pong
I am sharing the game code and resources for the pygame fossee event

# About the game
This game is similar to ping-pong except some mirrors are present which act like a wall and bounce back the ball.
The mirror turns red in the third collision, after which the ball goes to the other side of the mirror taking the image's velocity.
It can be simply termed as the ball converts into image and the image becomes ball.
The libraries used are pygame,random,time and sys

# levels and goals
The game consists of two modes, single player and two player mode.
In both modes there are four rooms available with increasing order of difficulty.
In single player mode, the player has to get 10 points before computer to win.
In two player mode the the rules are same and the player who gets 10 points first wins.
The game requires a lot of reflex because the ball will be very fast and hard to guess

# movements and buttons
The left board can be moved by 'w->up','s->down' and right board by 'up key' and 'down key'.
In single player mode the left is played by computer and the player can control the right board.

Hope you enjoy the game!
